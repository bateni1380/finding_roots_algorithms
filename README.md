# finding_roots_algorithms
This was a project for Basics of numerical analysis course tought by Dr. Shakeri in December 2022 at Amirkabir University of Tecknology.

In this notebook I've implemented Bisection, False Position and Secant methods to find roots of an equation and also I compared these methods.
